👩🏻‍💻 This is my take on a full-fledged blog website, where users can register, log in, explore different articles

What else is available:

- every user can write a post
- if you are the author of the post you can edit/delete it
- any user can leave a comment under any post
- if you are the author of the comment you can delete it
- every user can like/unlike any post
- there is a dashboard that shows all the user's favourite posts + the posts they have written

This project is my capstone project on 100 Days of Code course (Days 67-69).
It's done using Flask framework.
